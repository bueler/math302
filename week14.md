## Week 14 Module: April 22 -- April 26

Welcome to Week 14 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 11** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 3.3 and 8.1**.

This week we continue with systems of ODEs, and thus vectors and matrices.

To solve the system X'=AX we start by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.  As explained in section 8.2, the solution is a combination of the eigenvectors times exponentials.  The eigenvalues are the exponential rates.  This recipe generalizes everything we have done so far with linear ODEs so far.

Actually, in 8.4 we get an even more clean description.  The solution of a homogeneous linear system with constant coefficients always comes from an exponential, though generally we _exponentiate a matrix_.  These advanced ideas are not as scary as they seem because Matlab/Octave etc. are designed to do all the hard work.
