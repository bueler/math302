## Week 9 Module: March 18 -- March 22

Welcome to Week 9 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 7** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 5.1 and 5.3/4.10**.  Look at the WebAssign questions to see what kinds of problems I will ask about on the Quiz.

Mini-Project 3 is due this week on Monday March 18 (_a change from the original schedule_).  Mini-Project 4 is also assigned this week.

This week start using series methods on differential equations.
