## Week 9 Module: March 18 -- March 22

Welcome to Week 9 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 7** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 5.1 and 5.3/4.10**.  Look at the WebAssign questions, and do my videos, to see what kinds of problems I will ask about on the Quiz.

Mini-Project 3 is due this week on Monday March 18 (_which is a change from the original schedule_).  Mini-Project 4 is also assigned this week.

This week we start using power series methods on differential equations.  The method in section 6.2 allows the construction of the exact solution to some differential equations which we have not, until now, been able to solve.  Section 6.1 is a review of series and introduction to the idea of using series.  Series methods are important but limited so we skip sections 6.3 and 6.4 in favor of bigger ideas.
