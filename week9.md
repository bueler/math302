## Week 9 Module: March 18 -- March 22

Welcome to Week 9 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 7** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 5.1 and 5.3/4.10**.  Look at the WebAssign questions, and my videos, to see what kinds of problems I will ask about on the Quiz.

Mini-Project 3 is due this week on Monday March 18 (_which is a change from the original schedule_).  Mini-Project 4 is also assigned this week.

This week we start using power series methods on differential equations.  Section 6.1 is a review of series and introduction to the idea of using series on DEs.  The method in section 6.2 allows the construction of the solution to some DEs which we have not, until now, been able to solve.  Series methods are important but limited in power, and so we skip sections 6.3 and 6.4 in favor of bigger ideas.
