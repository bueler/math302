  Dennis G. Zill, _A First Course in Differential Equations with Modeling Applications_, 11th ed., 2018.
  * Homework is due by 11:59PM on the due date shown below.  (Due dates are on the [Schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf) as well.)
  * Late homework is not accepted.
  * Turn in your homework via Gradescope; access it via [Canvas](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214).
    * See the [uploading Help page](techHelp.html) for scanning/uploading advice.
  * As indicated below, part of your Homework will be graded for correctness, and most just on completion and effort.  You should always get 100% on the latter!
  * Also see this [Advice on Doing Homework](hw-advice.html)!
  * The sections are <span style="color:HotPink">**IN REVERSE ORDER**</span> so you don't have to scroll so far.
