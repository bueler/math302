## Week 12 Module: April 8 -- April 12

Welcome to Week 12 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 9** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 7.1 and 7.2**.

We continue to use _Laplace transform_ methods to solve linear ODEs.  From [Week 11](week11) we already know what it is, how to calculate it for many functions, how to calculate the inverse transform of many functions, and how to use it to solve some linear, constant-coefficient ODE IVPs.

This week we focus on "operational" properties of the Laplace transform which allow us to solve harder ODE IVPs, and which also illuminate what the Laplace transform of a solution means.  We cover essentially all of section 7.3, including translation properties and the unit step function.  Only one topic from 7.4 will be covered, namely the convolution.
