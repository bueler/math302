## Week 12 Module: April 8 -- April 12

Welcome to Week 12 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 9** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 7.1 and 7.2**.

This week we continue to use _Laplace transform_ methods to solve linear ODEs.  From [Week 11](week11) we already know what the Laplace transform is, know how to calculate many forward and inverse transforms, and know how to solve some linear, constant-coefficient ODE IVPs using it.  This week we focus on "operational" properties of the Laplace transform which allow us to solve harder ODE IVPs, and which also illuminate what the Laplace transform of a solution means.  We cover all of section 7.3, including translation properties and the unit step function.  Only one topic from 7.4 will be covered, namely the convolution.
