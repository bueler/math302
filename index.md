title: Math F302 Differential Equations in Fall 2023 at UAF
---

Welcome to the homepage of in-person **Math F302 Differential Equations** for Fall 2023.

### Instructor

[Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/) is in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

### Canvas Website

Log in to [canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214) for Homework and Exam solutions, to see your grades, and recorded lectures.

### Getting Started

* Attend lectures: MWF 10:30-11:30am, Gruening 408.

* Read the [syllabus](assets/general/F23/syllabus.pdf).

* See the [schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf).  Go there often to find out what happens next.

* See the [Daily Materials](daily.html) tab, for slides and worksheets.  Zoom recordings of the lectures are Announcements on the [Canvas website](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214).

* [Homework](homework.html) is assigned by section of the textbook.  Please turn it using [Gradescope](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214) by 11:59pm on the due date shown on the [schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf) and the [Homework](homework.html) tab.  Get to [Gradescope via the Canvas site](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214).

* [Quizzes](quizzes.html) and [Exams](exams.html) happen on Wednesdays.  See the [schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf).

* What are we studying? Check out these Wikipedia pages for the topics we will get to, introduced in this approximate order:

    * [ordinary differential equations (ODEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)
    * [initial value problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem)
    * [linear ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_differential_equation)
    * [exponential growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth)
    * [Newton's second law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)
    * [direction (slope) fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field)
    * [separable ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_variables)
    * [numerical methods for ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations)
    * [mass-spring systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-spring-damper_model)
    * [series solutions of ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series_solution_of_differential_equations)
    * [Laplace transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform)
    * [systems of ODEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_differential_equations)

* If you [solve this ridiculously hard partial differential equation problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium/navier-stokes-equation/) about fluids then you get $1 million.  On the other hand, every fluids scientist or engineer takes for granted that they can [solve that same problem very accurately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAVRgIrUOU),  if not exactly
