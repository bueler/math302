---

Welcome to the homepage of in-person **Math F302 Differential Equations** for Fall 2023.

### Instructor

[Ed Bueler](http://bueler.github.io/) is in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

### Canvas Website

Log in to [canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/16214) for Homework and Exam solutions, to see your grades, and recorded lectures.

### Getting Started

* [Quizzes](quizzes.html) and [Exams](exams.html) happen on Wednesdays.  See the [schedule](assets/general/F23/schedule.pdf).

### Important Links

* [Watch this 3blue1brown "tour of differential equations" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4)

* if you [solve this ridiculously hard partial differential equation problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium/navier-stokes-equation/) about fluids then you get $1 million, but on the other hand every [fluids scientist or engineer takes for granted that they can solve that same problem very accurately if not exactly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKAVRgIrUOU)
