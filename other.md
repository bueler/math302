## Other Materials

### Codes

Here are some codes I wrote, listed in chronological order:

* [dirfield.py](assets/codes/dirfield.py): Generate a direction field.  I used this for images in some slides.  You will need to know [Python](https://www.python.org/) to use this.  If you don't, see the [wikipedia page on slope fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field) for some easier code in Matlab or Mathematica.
* [streamcyl.m](assets/codes/streamcyl.m): Matlab code to generate a contour figure, showing streamlines around a cylinder, for Example 5 in the [slides for section 2.4](assets/slides/2-4.pdf).
* [eulersequence.py](assets/codes/eulersequence.py): Python code for sequence of figures used in [slides for section 2.6](assets/slides/2-6.pdf).
* [simpleeuler.m](assets/codes/simpleeuler.m): Matlab code to solve the simplest ODE IVP (y'=y,y(0)=1) by the Euler method.
* [simpleeulerplot.m](assets/codes/simpleeulerplot.m): A version of the above that plots the solution for h=0.1 and h=0.05.
* [plotcensus.m](assets/codes/plotcensus.m): Matlab code to plot US census data from exercise 4 in section 3.2; see [slides for section 3.2](assets/slides/3-2.pdf)
* [fitcensus.m](assets/codes/fitcensus.m): Matlab code to fit the logistic model to the US census data; see [slides for section 3.2](assets/slides/3-2.pdf)
