## Other Materials

### Codes:

* [dirfield.py](assets/codes/dirfield.py): Generate a direction field.  I used this for images in some slides.  You will need to know [Python](https://www.python.org/) to use this.  If you don't, see the [wikipedia page on slope fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field) for some easier code in Matlab or Mathematica.
* [streamcyl.m](assets/codes/streamcyl.m): Generates a contour figure, showing streamlines around a cylinder, for Example 5 in the [slides for section 2.4](assets/slides/2-4.pdf).
