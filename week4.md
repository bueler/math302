## Week 4 Module: February 4 -- February 8

Welcome to Week 4 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!

Remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

Proctored Quiz 3 should be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  Note Mini-Project 2 is due _this week_ on Thursday 2/7.

This week have one more type of first-order DE for which a solution formula may be found, namely the _exact equations_ in section 2.4.  Then we skip section 2.5; it collects a few more solvable DEs which are not very memorable and can be looked-up as needed.  Then we do something really important and general in section 2.6: use a straightforward computer loop (iteration) called _Euler's method_ to approximately solve an ODE IVP.
