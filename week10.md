## Week 10 Module: March 25 -- March 29

Welcome to Week 10 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 8** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 6.1 and 6.2**.  Look at the WebAssign questions to see what kinds of problems I will ask about on the Quiz.

Mini-Project 4 is due this week on Thursday March 28.

This week we return to numerical methods.  Section 9.1 is a deeper examination of Euler's method and a construction of the _improved Euler method_.  Section 9.2 discusses an even better method, the classical _Runge-Kutta order 4_ (RK4) method.  In fact [Runge-Kutta methods are a large family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods), and the improved Euler method is a Runge-Kutta method of order 2.  RK4 is an example of the kind of methods which are in "black boxes" like [ode45](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html) used earlier in section 5.3.
