## Week 5 Module: February 11 -- February 15

Welcome to Week 5 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, proctored Quiz 4 should be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  There is no Mini-Project this week, neither assigned nor due.

Regarding content, we are back to modeling with first-order DEs.  The questions in section 3.1 are about concrete calculations with the solutions of _linear_ first-order DEs.  Mostly these come down to questions about exponential decay and growth.  Section 3.2 is more interesting; there are applications of certain _separable_ equations especially.  Thus we see how useful the method in section 2.2 is.

_Next week_ is Midterm 1; it needs to be done on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of Week 6.  Below is a link to a sample Midterm, and watch for a Piazza message as a brief study guide.
