## Week 5 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 5 of [MATH F302](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

Regarding content, we are back to modeling with first-order DEs.  The questions in section 3.1 are about concrete calculations with the solutions of _linear_ first-order DEs.  Mostly these come down to questions about exponential decay and growth.  Section 3.2 is more interesting; there are applications of certain nonlinear and separable equations especially.  We see the utility of the method in section 2.2.

Midterm 1 covers sections

  1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1, and 3.2

It happens _next week_, namely [Week 6](week6).  Below is a link to a sample Midterm.  Watch for a study guide.
