## Week 6 Module: February 18 -- February 22

Welcome to Week 6 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **proctored Midterm 1** must be done on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday!  It **covers sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1, and 3.2**

As illustrated on the sample Midterm---see [Week 5](week5)---the problems on the midterm are very much like the problems you have seen on Quizzes and WebAssign homework.

There is no Mini-Project this week, neither assigned nor due.

Regarding new content, _not covered on Midterm 1_, we start into second-order differential equations.  (And higher order, but if you can handle second order then higher is just more of the same ideas.)  Section 4.1 is _important_ terminology and theory, which is the framework into which the various methods in latter sections is put.  Then we do section 4.3 on constant-coefficient ODEs; in [Week 7](week7) we get back to section 4.2.
