\begin{aproblems}
\aproblem \emph{Chain rule.}  Recall the chain rule
    $$\left[f\left(g(x)\right)\right]' = f'\left(g(x)\right)\, g'(x)$$

\epart{a} Compute the derivative.  Identify the outer function $f(x)$ and the inner function $g(x)$ you used.
    $$\left[\sqrt{\arctan x + 3 x}\right]' = \hspace{4.0in}$$

\vfill

\epart{b} Construct your own chain rule example.  (\emph{Make it non-trivial but not too complicated.  In particular, neither $f(x)$ nor $g(x)$ should be as simple as a linear function, i.e.~$ax+b$.})
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= \phantom{\sin x sdfakljdklja f sdabj adfs asdfk afdklj asdf \Big|}\\
g(x) &= \phantom{2^x + \ln x} \phantom{\Big|}\\
\left[f\left(g(x)\right)\right]' &=  \phantom{\Big|}
\end{align*}

\vspace{0.5in}
\noindent (\emph{Remember that $x^k,e^x,\ln x,b^x,\log_b x,\sin x,\cos x,\tan x,\sec x,\arcsin x$ are some common functions from calculus which you must be able to correctly differentiate!  You might use this problem to practice the ones that are least familiar.})

\newpage
\aproblem \emph{Integration by substitution.}  Starting with basics, remember that the indefinite integral just means ``anti-derivative''.  In fact
    $$\int f(x)\,dx = F(x) + C$$
means exactly the same thing as
    $$\left(F(x)\right)' = f(x).$$
You can do some integrals just by recognizing a derivative, perhaps with some fiddling with constants.

\epart{a} Compute the indefinite integral:
    $$\int \frac{1}{x}\,dx = \hspace{4.0in}$$

\bigskip

\epart{b} Compute the indefinite integral:
    $$\int 3^{2x}\,dx = \hspace{4.0in}$$

\bigskip

Integration by substitution is \textbf{the chain rule in reverse}.  For example, from \textbf{1 (a)} we have
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{\sec^2 x + 3}{\sqrt{\arctan x + 3 x}}\,dx &= \int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u}} \hspace{1.0in} [\text{with } u=\arctan x + 3x] \\
  &= 2 u^{1/2} + C = 2 \sqrt{\arctan x + 3 x} + C
\end{align*}
(It is common to need to fiddle with constant factors like the ``$2$'' here.)  In general:
   $$\int f'(g(x)) g'(x)\,dx = \int f'(u)\,du = f(u) + C = f(g(u)) + C$$

\epart{c} Turn \textbf{1 (b)} into an integration by substitution.

\vfill

\newpage
\aproblem  \emph{Product rule and integration-by-parts.}  The product rule
    $$\left[u(x) v(x)\right]' = u'(x) v(x) + u(x) v'(x)$$
can be used in reverse too.  The indefinite integral of both sides of the above gives
    $$u(x) v(x) = \int u'(x) v(x)\,dx + \int u(x) v'(x)\,dx.$$
The main use of this is to exchange one of the last two integrals for the other; \emph{that} is integration-by-parts:
    $$\int u(x) v'(x)\,dx = u(x) v(x) - \int u'(x) v(x)\,dx.$$
You probably have it memorized as
    $$\int u\, dv = u v - \int v\,du.$$

\epart{a} Construct your own product rule example.  (\emph{Again, make it non-trivial but not too complicated; $u(x),v(x)$ should not be as simple linear functions.})
\begin{align*}
u(x) &= \phantom{\sin x sdfakljdklja f sdabj adfs asdfk afdklj asdf \Big|}\\
v(x) &= \phantom{2^x + \ln x} \phantom{\Big|}\\
\left[u(x) v(x)\right]' &=  \phantom{\Big|}
\end{align*}

\vspace{0.3in}

\epart{b} Take the example in \textbf{(a)} and turn it into an integration-by-parts example.

\vfill

\newpage
\aproblem  \emph{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC).}  When you compute a definite integral by hand you usually use a form of the FTC:
    $$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a) \qquad \text{where } F'(x) = f(x)$$
This form of the FTC says that doing an integral is the same as un-doing a derivative.  Recall that if you do such an integral by substitution then you can change the limits:
    $$\int_{x=a}^{x=b} f(g(x))\,g'(x)\,dx = \int_{u=g(a)}^{u=g(b)} f(u)\,du = F(g(b)) - F(g(a))$$

\epart{a}  Compute
    $$\int_{\pi/6}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos x}{1 + 9 \sin^2 x}\,dx = \phantom{\int_{3/2}^3 \frac{du/3}{1+u^2} =} \hspace{3.0in}$$

\vspace{0.5in}

But there is another form of the FTC, often called FTC I.  It says that a derivative un-does an integral:
    $$\frac{d}{dx} \left(\int_a^x f(t)\,dt\right) = f(x)$$
The integral inside the parentheses computes the area under the curve $y=f(t)$ from $t=a$ to $t=x$, and one should think of this area varying as $x$ changes.  Thus it defines a function, namely $g(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\,dt$.  You can answer some questions about this function even if you cannot find an antiderivative of the integrand.

\epart{b}  Suppose we define
    $$g(x) = \int_0^x \sin(e^t)\,dt$$
Compute the exact value of $g(0)$.

\vspace{0.5in}

\epart{c}  For the same function $g(x)$, find $g'(x)$.
