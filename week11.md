## Week 11 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 11 of [MATH F302](index.html).  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

This week, **Midterm Exam 2** is on FIXME.  It **covers sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.10, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 9.1, and 9.2**.  See the [summary of Midterm Exam 2](assets/sample/mid2-summary.pdf), an explicit guide to what will be on the midterm.  (It replaces a Sample exam, which I have not produced.)

This week and in [Week 12](week12) we use _Laplace transform_ methods to solve linear ODEs.  Section 7.1 is about the definition of the Laplace transform, which is an integral which expresses the solution as a combination of many exponential rates.  In section 7.2 we actually start to use it to solve ODEs.  We also start to see that the Laplace transform is a way engineers understand the relationship between the driving force (nonhomogeneity) and the response (solution) by using the Laplace transform to turn the ODE into an algebraic equation.  The new equation is just multiplication by the _transfer function_.
