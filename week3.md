## Week 3 Module: January 28 -- February 1

Welcome to Week 3 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!

Remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

Proctored Quiz 2 should be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  Note Mini-Project 2 is assigned this week but it is due on Thursday 2/7 (during Week 4).

The videos are different this week; I used [Learning Glass](https://iteachu.uaf.edu/deliver-engaging-lectures/).  I don't particularly like either the creation process or the result; in future weeks we will be back to [Explain Everything](https://explaineverything.com/) videos.

This week we get a serious start on actually _solving_ first-order differential equations.  The two types we solve are called "separable" (section 2.2) and linear (section 2.3).
