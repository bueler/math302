## Week 3 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 3 of [MATH F302](index.html)!

Remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

Mini-Project 2 is assigned this week but it is due on FIXME.

This week we get a serious start on actually _solving_ first-order differential equations.  The two types we solve are called "separable" (section 2.2) and linear (section 2.3).

### Monday 1/28

### Wednesday 1/30
* FIXME

### Friday 2/1
