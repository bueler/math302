## Week 3 Module: January 28 -- February 1

Welcome to Week 3 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!

Remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).  Note Quiz 2 is scheduled for this week.  Note Mini-Project 2 is assigned this week but it is due during Week 4, on Thursday 2/7.

This week we get a serious start on actually _solving_ first-order differential equations.  The two types we solve are called "separable" (section 2.2) and linear (section 2.3).
