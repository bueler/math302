## Week 1 Module: FIXME

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Welcome to Week 1 of [MATH F302](index.html)!

Make sure to read the [syllabus](syllabus.pdf) and the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

This week is about an introduction to differential equations (DEs), of course.  A lot of it is terminology, especially section 1.1.  Section 1.2 is key to the idea that DEs are _models capable of prediction_ as long as we add initial conditions.

### Monday 1/14
