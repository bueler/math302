## Week 2 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 2 of [MATH F302](index.html)!

Make sure to read the [syllabus](syllabus.pdf) and the [schedule](schedule.pdf).  Keep up to date with announcements, and communicate with students and the instructor.

This week is about differential equations as models.  It is also about ways to picture differential equations using direction fields and phase portraits; such visualization can happen even if we cannot find solution formulas.  Such formulas get seriously going in [Week 3](week3).

* [wikipedia page for "slope field"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field) has short codes for plotting them
* I wrote a [Python code dirfield.py](other) for generating direction fields
* there is a [Slope Field Generator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/p7vd3cdmei) at [desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com)
* there is a slope field web applet at [slopefield.nathangrigg.net](http://slopefield.nathangrigg.net/)
* and many more you can find ...
