## Week 6 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 6 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

This week, **Midterm 1** must be done on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday!  It **covers sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 3.1, and 3.2**

The problems on the Midterm are very much like the problems you have seen on Quizzes and homework.  For examples, see the sample Midterm on the [Week 5](week5) page.

There is no Mini-Project this week, neither assigned nor due.

Regarding new content, we start into second-order differential equations.  (We also see higher order DEs.  However, if you can handle second order then higher is just more of the same ideas.)  Section 4.1 is _important_ terminology and theory, the framework into which the various methods in latter sections are put.  Then we do section 4.3 on constant-coefficient ODEs.  In [Week 7](week7) we will get back to section 4.2.
