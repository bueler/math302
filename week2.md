## Week 2 Module: January 21 -- January 25

Welcome to Week 2 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!

Make sure to read the [syllabus](syllabus.pdf), the [schedule](schedule.pdf), and [how to set up proctoring](proctoring.pdf).  Keep up to date with announcements, and communicate with students and the instructor, at [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

The first proctored Quiz is scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday of this week!

This week is about differential equations as models.  It is also about ways to picture differential equations using direction fields and phase portraits; such visualization can happen even if we cannot find solution formulas.  Such formulas get seriously going in [Week 3](week3).
