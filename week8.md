## Week 8 Module: March 4 -- March 8

Welcome to Week 8 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 6** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 4.2 and 4.4**

Mini-Project 3 is due this week on Thursday March 7.

This week we do modeling with linear second-order differential equations.  Section 5.1 is about the most important physical interpretation of a second-order DE, namely a _mass-spring system_.  Section 5.3 extends to _nonlinear models_ including more-realistic nonlinear springs, pendulums, and variable gravity or mass.

Note that next week is Spring Break.  We resume [Week 9](week9) on Monday 3/18.
