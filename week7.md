## Week 7 Module: FIXME

Welcome to Week 7 of [MATH F302](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf).

This week, **Quiz 5** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 4.1 and 4.3**

Mini-Project 3 is assigned this week and due [next week](week8) on Thursday March 7.

This week we continue solving linear second-order differential equations.  The _reduction of order_ technique in section 4.2 provides a second solution if one solution is already known.  This technique explains the repeated-root rule seen in section 4.3.  The _undetermined coefficients_ method in section 4.4 will be our primary method for solving nonhomogeneous linear equations.  Note that to use undetermined coefficients for the _particular solution_ $$y_p$$ you must already know the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation, i.e. the _complementary function_ $$y_c$$.
