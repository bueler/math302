## Week 7 Module: February 25 -- March 1

Welcome to Week 7 of [MATH F302 UX1 in Spring 2019](index.html)!  As always, remember to keep an eye on the [schedule](schedule.pdf) and [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math302ux1/home).

This week, **Quiz 5** must be done on Wednesday or Thursday.  It **covers sections 4.1 and 4.3**

Mini-Project 3 is assigned this week and due [next week](week8) on Thursday March 7.

This week we continue solving second-order differential equations.
