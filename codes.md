## Codes

This page will grow over the course of the semester.  It has some computer codes I wrote, either for visualization or as examples of numerical methods.  They are categorized by language (Matlab/Octave or Python), and ordered chronologically.

### Matlab/Octave: Visualization

You can use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) with these.  (I use Octave, which is free and open source.)

* To generate direction fields (slope fields) in Matlab, see see the [wikipedia page on slope fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field).

<!--
* [streamcyl.m](assets/codes/F23/streamcyl.m): Generate a contour figure, showing streamlines around a cylinder, for Example 5 in the slides for section 2.4.

### Matlab/Octave: Numerical methods

* [simpleeuler.m](assets/codes/F23/simpleeuler.m): Solve the simplest ODE IVP (y'=y,y(0)=1) by the Euler method.  See the slides for section 2.6.

### Python

You will need to know [Python](https://www.python.org/) to use these.

* [dirfield.py](assets/codes/F23/dirfield.py):  Generate a direction field.  I used this for images in some slides.

### with just a web browser

* The are online versions [Matlab online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) and [Octave Online](https://octave-online.net/).
* To generate direction fields without programming, try [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/).
