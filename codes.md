## Codes

This page has some computer codes I wrote, mostly for visualization.  They are categorized by language (Matlab/Octave or Python), and for each language they are ordered chronologically.

### Matlab/Octave Codes

You can use [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) with these.  I use Octave.

* [streamcyl.m](assets/codes/streamcyl.m): Generate a contour figure, showing streamlines around a cylinder, for Example 5 in the [slides for section 2.4](assets/slides/2-4.pdf).
* [simpleeuler.m](assets/codes/simpleeuler.m): Solve the simplest ODE IVP (y'=y,y(0)=1) by the Euler method.
* [simpleeulerplot.m](assets/codes/simpleeulerplot.m): A version of the above that plots the solution for h=0.1 and h=0.05.
* [plotcensus.m](assets/codes/plotcensus.m): Plot US census data from exercise 4 in section 3.2; see [slides for section 3.2](assets/slides/3-2.pdf).
* [fitcensus.m](assets/codes/fitcensus.m): Fit the logistic model to the US census data; see [slides for section 3.2](assets/slides/3-2.pdf).
* [oilslick.m](assets/codes/oilslick.m): Solution to parts (b), (c), and (d) of Mini-Project 2.  Plots rate of change of area versus area.
* [slicker.m](assets/codes/slicker.m): Solution to parts (f) and (g) of Mini-Project 2.  Plots A(t) solution, with data superimposed.
* [massspringplot.m](assets/codes/massspringplot.m): Used to generate some figures in [slides for section 5.1](assets/slides/5-1.pdf).
* [pendmovie.m](assets/codes/pendmovie.m): Generates this [movie](assets/codes/pendmovie.gif) mentioned in [slides for section 5.3](assets/slides/5-3.pdf).
* [springs.m](assets/codes/springs.m): Generates this figures in [slides for section 5.3](assets/slides/5-3.pdf).

### Python Codes

You will need to know [Python](https://www.python.org/) to use these.

* [dirfield.py](assets/codes/dirfield.py): Generate a direction field.  I used this for images in some slides.
    * To generate direction fields without programming, try [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/).  For other languages see the [wikipedia page on slope fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_field); it gives easy codes in Matlab and Mathematica.
* [eulersequence.py](assets/codes/eulersequence.py): Generate sequence of figures used in [slides for section 2.6](assets/slides/2-6.pdf).
